# DLFL Handwritten Digit Recognition GUI
Implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset and deploy using tkinter.
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
